              <li>
                redBus only provides a technology platform that connects
                intending travellers with bus operators. It doesn’t operate any
                bus or offer the service of transportation to the User. redBus
                also doesn’t act as an agent of any bus operator in the process
                of providing the above-mentioned technology platform services.
              </li>
              <li>
                redBus acts as a facilitator connecting intending customers to
                bus operators offering sale of tickets. Accordingly, the
                contract of sale of services on the Website is strictly a
                bipartite contract between the User and the bus operator listed
                on the Website.
              </li>
              <li>
                The bus ticket booking voucher which redBus issues to a User is
                solely based on the information provided or updated by the bus
                operator regarding the seat availability.
              </li>
              <li>
                The amenities, services, routes, fares, schedule, bus type, seat
                availability and any other details pertaining to the bus service
                are provided by the respective bus operator and redBus has no
                control over such information provided by the bus operator.

                The hotel booking voucher which redBus issues to a User is
                solely based on the information provided or updated by the hotel

                expenses that may be incurred during their stay. Such deposit is
